# üõ°Ô∏è RetailShield ‚Äì AI-Powered Cybersecurity for Retail

RetailShield is a secure, intelligent authentication system for retail applications that detects threats using behavioral biometrics, IP validation, and OTP transformation logic. It aims to enhance login security by learning user-specific typing patterns and flagging suspicious login attempts based on behavioral deviation or IP mismatch.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Typing pattern‚Äìbased behavioral biometric authentication  
- ‚úÖ OTP transformation strategies for secure password recovery  
- ‚úÖ IP address validation and anomaly alert system  
- ‚úÖ Email alert on suspicious IP login attempt  
- ‚úÖ FastAPI backend for biometric comparison  
- ‚úÖ MERN stack frontend for smooth UI/UX

## üß† Problem Statement

Traditional authentication systems are vulnerable to phishing, credential theft, and brute-force attacks. Our solution introduces continuous, context-aware verification using biometrics and network data.

## üìä Datasets Used

We use publicly available datasets for keystroke dynamics:

- **CMU Keystroke Dataset** (Carnegie Mellon University)  
  üëâ [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~keystroke/](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~keystroke/)  
  Format includes dwell time and flight time for various users typing fixed passwords.

> If you're using a custom cleaned/preprocessed dataset, you can mention it here and optionally add a download link or `data/` folder in your repo.
